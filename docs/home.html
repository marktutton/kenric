<p><strong>Real LGBT Milwaukee: #Unraveling the Rainbow</strong> is a work in progress by author Kenric Oswy. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive, new and up-to-date resource tool and guide for gay individuals--young to old--as they form their own integrated identities within the Milwaukee LGBT community. In addition to gay people as a primary audience, the friends, family, parents and advocates of these individuals should also find this work to be a valuable resource.  </p>
